# Slurm integration

AMD Device Metrics Exporter integrates with Slurm workload manager to track GPU metrics for Slurm jobs. This topic explains how to set up and configure this integration.

## Prerequisites

- Slurm workload manager installed and configured
- AMD Device Metrics Exporter installed and running
- Root or sudo access on Slurm nodes

## Installation

- Copy the integration script:

```bash
sudo cp /usr/local/etc/metrics/slurm/slurm-prolog.sh /etc/slurm/
sudo cp /usr/local/etc/metrics/slurm/slurm-epilog.sh /etc/slurm/
sudo chmod +x /etc/slurm/slurm-*.sh
```

- Configure Slurm:

```bash
sudo vi /etc/slurm/slurm.conf

# Add these lines:
prologFlags=Alloc
Prolog=/etc/slurm/slurm-prolog.sh
Epilog=/etc/slurm/slurm-epilog.sh
```

- Restart Slurm services to apply changes:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart slurmctld  # On controller node
sudo systemctl restart slurmd     # On compute nodes
```

## Verification

- Submit a test job:

```bash
srun --gpus=1 amd-smi monitor
```

- Check metrics endpoint:

```bash
curl http://localhost:5000/metrics | grep job_id
```

You should see metrics tagged with the Slurm job ID.

## Metrics

When Slurm integration is enabled, the following job-specific labels are added to metrics:

- `job_id`: Slurm job ID
- `job_user`: Username of job owner
- `job_partition`: Slurm partition name
- `cluster_name`: Slurm cluster name

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. Script permissions:
   - Ensure the exporter script is executable
   - Verify proper ownership (should be owned by `root` or `slurm` user)

2. Configuration issues:
   - Check Slurm logs for prolog/epilog execution errors
   - Verify paths in slurm.conf are correct

3. Metric collection:
   - Ensure metrics exporter is running
   - Check if job ID labels are being properly set

4. Check service status:

```bash
systemctl status rdc.service gpuagent.service amd-metrics-exporter.service
```

### Logs

View Slurm logs for integration issues:

```bash
sudo tail -f /var/log/slurm/slurmd.log
```

View service logs:

```bash
journalctl -u rdc.service -u gpuagent.service -u amd-metrics-exporter.service
```

## Advanced Configuration

### Custom Script Location

You can place the script in a different location by updating the paths in `slurm.conf`:

```bash
Prolog=/path/to/custom/slurm-prolog.sh
Epilog=/path/to/custom/slurm-epilog.sh
```

### Additional Job Information

The integration script can be modified to include additional job-specific information in the metrics. Edit the script to add custom labels as needed.
